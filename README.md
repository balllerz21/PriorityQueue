# PriorityQueue
/* This is the first implemnation with a priority queue. The usage of the priority # queue is implemented by a Binary Search Tree. The queue uses a inorder traversal # method to tranverse through the queue. The unique aspect of this 
implemantation of the priority queue is that the items that repeat aren't  
deleted, instead it's linked into the same branch in the order that it was 
inserted from the oldest to the most recent by a linked list. 

This priority queue has constructors, destructors, an enqueue, a dequeue, size, and peek functions as well as operator overloads 

This project also comes with Google tests that test the funcionality of the priority queue*/
